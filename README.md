## What art thou **specTeX** that usurp'st this time of night?

`specTeX` is a package for the preparation of publication-quality acoustic figures for phonetics and speech science.


## The package is comprised of...??

There are two components to the specTeX thingamajigging process.

1. Export images and plot values from Praat
2. Include the images and related data into a figure object in the document
3. Define or apply figure style properties


## How do you work this thing?!?

The Praat script is used to export the acoustic data related to the figure. Next, the style file tells LaTeX how to organize the figure from its components.
